NOTES.txt: Design Notes 
Additional room for improvement:
	1. Need to do more extensive testing of insertionSort, shellsort, heapSort.
	2. Could not get mergeSort to work yet.
	3. Need to understand shellsort, heapsort, and mergesort more. Want to be able to code all sorts without reference.
	4. To finish: Need quicksort, radix sort, bubble sort?
